Branching Strategy
A good branching strategy will help you manage the development process:-
Main branch:- This is the stable branch where the code is production-ready. Avoid direct commits to main or master.
Develop branch:- If your project has multiple developers or you want to isolate features, you can have a develop branch. This is where features are merged before being released to main.
Feature branches:- Create a new branch for every new feature or bugfix. This keeps your work isolated until it's ready to be merged.
